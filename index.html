    <p>This map details both professional and college basketball arenas in Florida. Essentially, these are the locations where crowds gather to watch the most talented hoopers in the state of Florida. These venues are home to qualified basketball players who play the best of the best in the NBA and the NCAA. I enjoyed creating this map as a basketball lover myself, and I hope that it is useful in some sense to anyone who enjoys watching basketball. </p>
