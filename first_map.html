    <h1>Locations I Frequently Visit in Lakeland, Florida</h1>

    <p>My name is Reese Hutchins and this map is zoomed in on the area where I grew up in Lakeland, Florida. This is my hometown in the center of Florida. Steaming hot in the summers, it is a quiet town with lots of great food and a growing population and urban area. I have marked a few locations that I most frequently visited while growing up in Lakeland. These include my house, the first gym I ever worked out in, the first job I ever had, and the gas station I most frequently use near my house. </p>
